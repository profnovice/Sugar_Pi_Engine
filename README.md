# Ongoing c++ simple game engine from scratch using CMake SFML Project Template

Learning process with C++, SFML, CMake, etc.

## Git commit format

### Example:

feat(src): Add new jump ability 

Testers were bored while in the air so this flip ability should 
give them something to do.

### Flags:

chore: typos, documentation
style: reformatting, rearranging
feat: new feature, system
fix: solution to an issue
refac: making it better without changing what it does
test: check to see that things run correctly
explr: experiment with libraries and new features
clean: remove unnecessary code or comments

### Areas:

git: workflows 
docs: README and LICENSE etc.
src: source code
assets: textures, config, .ttf etc

### Creed: 

Separate subject from body with a blank line
Limit the subject line to 50 characters
Capitalize the subject line
Do not end the subject line with a period
Use the imperative mood in the subject line: "if applied this commit will"
Wrap the body at 72 characters
Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
